Taco Cloud is a web application where users can design their own tacos made of a predefined list of ingredients that they can selectively choose from to have different taco designs.

the users can also order the designs they created
with an order form, eventually all the tacos and the orders that are created will be stored in adatabase to be retrieved later by the user who created them.
